# Digits Finder

In this project, I use a pretrained model based on [HyperLPR](https://github.com/zeusees/HyperLPR), which is a license plate recognition model suited in China.

Combining this model and some web application functions including User Login, Payment, and Demo, I create a prototype web service called [Digits Finder](https://digitsfinder.herokuapp.com/index) which aims to recoginize numbers and characters in images or videos very fast and accurate in the future developements.
