# Fraud detection using Scikit Learn

In this project, I use [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) packages to train Logistic regression model and predict the fraudulence.

The dataset I use is [IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/data) in Kaggle competition.


The details are in the notebook.
